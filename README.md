# verish
my half finished shell written in rust
## what is verish
verish is a shell inspired by ash made for linux systems
its early in dev and isnt finished at all and was made for fun!!
## features
- running commands and builtins (cd, exit, clear etc)
- basic job control (&)
- some modern shell features (~ instead of /home/user)
## why i made it
to learn rust (my new favourite language now haha)
and i was bored
## to test it
make sure you have cargo and rustup and the nix crate
all you have to do is clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/v1nch3ns0/verish`
and just run (`cargo run`)
## todo
- redirection (<, >, >>)
- piping
- better job control
- scripting
